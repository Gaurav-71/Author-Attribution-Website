      Development and Analysis of Real-time Computational Linguistic Algorithms
      for Authorship Prediction on Indian Regional Languages
    </div>
    <p class="mt-6">
      Authorship prediction is one of the popular applications of Natural
      language processing. It is a task of predicting the probability of a true
      author of an anonymous text based on his/her writing style. Kannada being
      one of the popular south Indian languages is lagging in this domain. It is
      the state language of Karnataka and spoken by more than 50 million people
      around the globe. The language has a rich set of vocabulary, grammar and
      literature. Text processing on many Indian regional languages is
      progressing highly but in Kannada, it is still in a tender stage. The
      proposed work mainly focuses on predicting the authorship of an unknown
      Kannada text based on the Stylometry features.

      The proposed work will be contributed to Karnataka Ganaka Parishath a
      voluntary organization contributed in the area of Kannada text processing.
      KAGAPA has contributed voluminous dataset for the proposed work. KAGAPA
      will be utilizing this tool to resolve any authorship issues in literature
      in future. The entire work will be automated and developed as an
      application tool and will be released for the public to use it.
